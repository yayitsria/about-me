    <h1>All about friendship bracelets!</h1>

    <div class = "fontSize">

    <p>I've been making friendship bracelets for about 6 years now. While it isn't that hard to start doing, it
        definitely requires a lot of patience and an eye for detail.
        Especially for bigger projects, there are hundreds to potentially thousands of knots required to to create a
        bracelet.
    </p>

    <p class = "emphasis">You're not limited to bracelets, either. Friendship bracelet patterns can also make excellent bookmarks and
        necklaces as well!</p>

    <p>The only required materials are:</p>
    <li>Embroidery floss</li>
    <li>Scissors</li>

    <p>My favorite website to get patterns from is <a class = "emphasis" href="https://friendship-bracelets.net"
            target=_blank>friendship-bracelets.net</a>.
